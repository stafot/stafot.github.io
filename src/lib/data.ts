# Mattermost's Cloud Optimization Journey: Pillars of Success

This article was originally published on the Mattermost Engineering Blog.

## Cloud Optimization: Pillars of Success

At Mattermost, we've embarked on a transformative journey in cloud optimization, marked by strategic initiatives and innovative approaches. Here are the key pillars that have guided our success:

### 1. Systematic Cost Tracking

- Established foundation for cloud expense visibility
- Introduced measurable KPIs like Average Production Workspace Cost
- Built advanced monthly cost tracking reports

### 2. Infrastructure Optimization

- Deployed database proxy for efficient multi-tenancy
- Implemented automated cleanup solutions using AWS Lambda
- Created custom cost alerting tools

Our optimization efforts have resulted in significant cost savings while maintaining high performance standards for our cloud services.

# SLO Monitoring and Alerting with Prometheus and Sloth

Implementing Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is essential for maintaining reliable services. This article explores how to leverage Prometheus and Sloth for effective SLO monitoring.

## What are SLOs?

Service Level Objectives define targets for service performance and reliability. Unlike SLAs (Service Level Agreements), SLOs are internal goals that help teams measure service health.

## Setting Up Prometheus for SLO Monitoring

1. Define meaningful metrics
2. Configure Prometheus to collect these metrics
3. Set up appropriate recording rules

## Using Sloth to Manage SLOs

Sloth is a powerful tool that generates Prometheus rules based on SLO definitions. It simplifies the process of creating and managing SLOs.

## Best Practices

- Start with realistic objectives
- Implement multi-window, multi-burn rate alerts
- Regularly review and adjust your SLOs

# Automating EKS Node Rotation for AMI Releases

Keeping your Amazon EKS clusters updated with the latest AMIs is crucial for security and performance. This article covers an automated approach to node rotation.

## The Challenge of Manual Updates

Manual node rotation is time-consuming and error-prone, especially across multiple clusters. Automation solves these issues while ensuring consistent application of updates.

## Solution Overview

Our automation solution uses:

- AWS Lambda functions triggered by AMI release events
- Step Functions to orchestrate the node rotation process
- CloudWatch Events for scheduling and monitoring

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up event detection for new AMI releases
2. Create a Lambda function to handle the update process
3. Implement safety checks before and after rotations
4. Configure proper logging and monitoring

## Results

After implementing this automation, we've seen:
- 90% reduction in manual effort
- Improved security posture with faster patching
- More consistent cluster state across environments

The complete code for this solution is available in our GitHub repository.

# Kubernetes Node Local DNS Cache Service

## Project Overview

This project implements a node-local DNS cache for Kubernetes clusters to improve DNS resolution performance and reliability.

## Problem Statement

DNS queries in Kubernetes clusters typically go through cluster DNS services like CoreDNS. This can introduce latency and reliability issues, especially in large clusters with high query volumes.

## Solution

The node-local DNS cache runs as a DaemonSet, deploying a DNS cache on every node in the cluster. This approach:

- Reduces DNS query latency by serving results from the local cache
- Decreases the load on cluster DNS services
- Improves reliability during cluster DNS service disruptions

## Implementation Details

- Used CoreDNS with custom configuration for the cache
- Implemented proper cache TTL settings for different record types
- Added monitoring with Prometheus metrics
- Created Grafana dashboards for visibility

## Results

After deploying this solution:
- 80% reduction in DNS query latency
- Significant decrease in load on cluster DNS services
- Improved application reliability during DNS service updates

The project is open source and available for contribution.

# Ingress NGINX Controller Improvements

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the Kubernetes Ingress NGINX Controller with features for improved performance, security, and observability.

## Key Enhancements

### Performance Optimizations

- Tuned worker processes and connections for higher throughput
- Implemented connection pooling for backend services
- Added intelligent caching policies for static content

### Security Improvements

- Enhanced TLS configuration with modern ciphers and protocols
- Implemented rate limiting and bot protection
- Added support for external authentication services

### Observability Enhancements

- Extended Prometheus metrics for deeper insights
- Created custom Grafana dashboards
- Improved logging with structured JSON format

## Implementation Process

The improvements were developed following a phased approach:

1. Research and benchmarking of current performance
2. Development and testing in isolated environments
3. Gradual rollout to production clusters
4. Monitoring and further optimization

## Results

These improvements resulted in:
- 35% increase in request throughput
- 40% reduction in latency for cached responses
- Significantly improved security posture against web attacks

The changes have been contributed back to the open source project.
